## Safari 5 historio.us Extension

This extension makes saving (historifying) sites with the online bookmarking service http://historio.us easier. Just click the button and your site will be saved in historious (it will *only* save sites you select, nothing else).

This extension was originally written by Alexander Solovyov (http://piranha.org.ua/) for Google Chrome and is available at [https://bitbucket.org/Stavros/historious.crx](https://bitbucket.org/Stavros/historious.crx).
It has been ported to Safari 5 by Maximillian Dornseif. The port is available at [https://github.com/mdornseif/historious.safariextension](https://github.com/mdornseif/historious.safariextension). The Safari port is unofficial and not supported by the historio.us team.

You can install the Chrome Extension [from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ofhbgdkgggdidebbnlhdkcfaegjdggii). The Safari Extension is available at [https://github.com/mdornseif/historious.safariextension/downloads](https://github.com/mdornseif/historious.safariextension/downloads).
